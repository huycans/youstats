Currently I'm looking to add typescript support for this app. If you have ideas about other functionalities and want to contribute, please create an issue so I know about it.

Typescript support should include type declarations in functions, variables and props and more. Basically, if you convert a JS file to TSX, please make sure typescript compiler doesn't throw an error.
